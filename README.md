# Graph Database Project - SPIRE

The NBA is one of the most followed sports in America. Every year it generates over
10.5 billion U.S. dollars in revenues. One important aspect nowadays is to study new
techniques to improve match performances. The NBA dataset offers dynamic data,
statistics, and information about players. This is a great opportunity to analyze and
explore various analytical techniques, from player statistics analysis to game prediction
models. Our dataset aims to describe the reality of the NBA basketball league. We decided to
work on these datasets because we thought that they were suitable for developing a
good team project, the number of entities and relations that could be created gives us
plenty of space to learn and to engineer a good graph database, combining in the
process our love for sports and specifically basketball in this case.
